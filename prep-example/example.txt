My Goals:

Be able to make a functional website.
  • Not ugly.
  • Has a database to pull from.
  • Doesn't confuse me.
  • Doesn't confuse them.

Make some fun stuff for myself.
  • I have a little discord bot, but lean alot on documentation.
    - I would like to understand it rather than piece it together.
  • Make some useful scripts/websites for myself or friends.

Just learn more about coding, especially data structures.
  • Just learn better, more efficent, ways to code.
  • Understand the stack finally. Hopefully.
  • Learn how to use git. Thanks!
